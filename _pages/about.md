### My Journey So Far üöÄ

<span style="font-size:0.95em;">
  I've had the privilege of studying at some amazing institutions, like Georgia Tech and Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham. These experiences have shaped me into the curious and driven individual I am today.
  As a software developer, I love building things that make life a little easier and a lot more fun. Whether it's a clever new app or a behind-the-scenes infrastructure tweak, I'm always looking for ways to innovate and improve.

<span style="font-size:0.95em;">
  During my tenure at TCS Research & Innovation Labs, I spearheaded the development of cutting-edge cloud architectures, employing Python, AWS, and Azure to design high-performance solutions for machine and deep learning workloads. My efforts yielded substantial cost reductions and contributed to the publication of research papers and patents in serverless computing. At Oracle Cerner Corporation, I focused on innovation and efficiency, creating a full-stack web application to streamline client onboarding, resulting in significant time savings. Additionally, I automated data-processing pipelines with technologies such as Hadoop and Elastic Map Reduce (EMR), enhancing data processing efficiency through algorithm optimization.
