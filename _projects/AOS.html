<h4> Virtual Machine Scheduling in KVM </h4> 
<ul>
    <li>Implemented a vCPU scheduler and a memory coordinator to dynamically manage resources assigned to each guest virtual machine </li>
    <li>Memory ballooning driver implementation.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Barrier Synchronization</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Implementation of barrier synchronization algorithms from the paper titled &quot;Algorithms for Scalable Synchronization on Shared-Memory Multiprocessors&quot; by John M. Mellor-Crummey (Rice University) and Michael L. Scott (University of Rochester), ACM Transactions on Computer Systems Vol. 9, No. 1, February 1991 &quot;</li>
    <li>Barriers implemented using OpenMP: Sense-Reversing Centralized Barrier and the MCS Tree Barrier</li>
    <li>Barriers implemented using Open MPI: MCS Tree Barrier and Dissemination Barrier</li>
