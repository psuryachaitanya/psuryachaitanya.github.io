<h3> Isolation Player </h3> 
<ul>
    <li>Use the MINIMAX and alpha-beta pruning techniques and experiment with evaluation functions to create a program that can play a variant of the game Isolation better than a human.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Search</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Experiment with various search techniques (A*, Bidirectional A*, Tridirectional A*) to discover the most efficient way to find the shortest path between three places in a map.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bayes Nets</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Implement Bayesian networks and sampling algorithms to gain a better understanding of probabilistic systems.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Decision Trees</h3>
<ul>
    <li> Build, train, and test several decision tree models to perform basic classification tasks.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Gaussian Mixture Models</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Implement k-means clustering and Gaussian mixture models to perform basic image segmentation. Research, implement, and test the Bayesian Information Criterion to guarantee a more robust image segmentation.</li>
