excerpt: "
<h3>Cloud Architect &nbsp; <em>[ Python, AWS, Azure, GCP ]</em> </h3>  
<ul>
  <li>
     Designed high-performance, cost-efficient, and scalable cloud architectures for inference and training of Machine and Deep Learning (DL) workloads. 
  </li>
  <li>
    Published 6 research papers at top tier conferences like High Performance and Distributed Computing (HDPC22), ICPE and filed 2 patents in the domain of serverless computing.
  </li>
  <li>
    Achieved a significant 30% reduction in execution costs by implementing a scalable FaaS-based architecture for document processing DL workflow, leveraging AWS Lambda, Elastic File System, and DynamoDB.
  </li>
  <li>
    Devised a Service Level Agreement (SLA) aware workload scheduling cloud architecture using AWS Sagemaker and Lambda. This architecture reduced the SLA violation to ~10% for the DL inference. link
  </li>
  <li>
     Developed a novel distributed model training approach addressing serverless platform limitations, alongside an analytical model to evaluate performance across data management services (S3, Memcached, DynamoDB), resulting in a 1.2x to 5.5x enhancement in training efficiency and cost-effectiveness. link
  </li>
  <li>
     Benchmarked and analyzed data transfer between cloud storage services and serverless computing across Azure, GCP, and AWS cloud platforms. link
  </li>
